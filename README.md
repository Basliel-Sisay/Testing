<h1>🧪 Testing Project</h1>

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript functions designed to reinforce core programming concepts through practical testing. Each function is implemented with clarity and tested using Jest to ensure correctness and reliability.

<h2>📚 Project Purpose</h2>

This project is built to strengthen foundational JavaScript skills through hands-on function implementation and testing. It emphasizes writing clean logic, understanding core algorithms, and validating code behavior using Jest.

<h2>🚀 Features</h2>

- ✅ Capitalize — Capitalizes the first letter of a given string. <br>
- ✅ Reverse String — Reverses the characters in a string. <br>
- ✅ Calculator — Performs basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).<br>
- ✅ Caesar Cipher — Encrypts a string using Caesar Cipher logic with case preservation and punctuation handling.<br>
- ✅ analyze array — returns the minimum, maximum, average, and length of a given array of numbers.<br>

<h2>🧪 Technologies Used</h2>

- JavaScript <br>
- Jest (for testing) <br>
- Git & GitHub<br>
